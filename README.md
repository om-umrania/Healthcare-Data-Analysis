# Healthcare-Data-Analysis

## Project: Healthcare Dataset Import Script

### Overview

This project contains a Python script designed to automate the process of downloading, extracting, and organizing healthcare datasets from specified URLs. The script is intended for use within a Kaggle environment, facilitating easy access and management of large datasets for machine learning and data analysis projects.

### Features

- Downloads datasets from specified URLs.
- Supports extraction of both `.zip` and `.tar` archives.
- Automatically organizes datasets into designated directories.
- Provides progress updates during the download process.
- Handles expired links and download errors gracefully.

### Installation

To use this script, you need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:
- `os`
- `sys`
- `tempfile`
- `urllib.request`
- `urllib.parse`
- `urllib.error`
- `zipfile`
- `tarfile`
- `shutil`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install urllib3
```

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-dataset-import.git
cd healthcare-dataset-import
```

2. **Run the script:**

   Execute the script in your Kaggle environment or local Python environment. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions and directory structure in place.

```sh
python import_datasets.py
```

### Script Details

The script performs the following operations:

1. **Set up directories and symlinks:**
   - Creates necessary input and working directories.
   - Sets up symbolic links for easy access to these directories.

2. **Download and extract datasets:**
   - Reads the dataset URL and target directory from the `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING`.
   - Downloads the dataset in chunks, showing progress in the console.
   - Extracts the dataset if it is in `.zip` or `.tar` format.
   - Handles errors gracefully, providing informative messages if a download fails.

### Configuration

Modify the `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING` variable to add or update dataset URLs and target directories. The format is as follows:

```python
DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING = 'directory_name:url_encoded_dataset_url'
```

### Example

```python
DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING = 'healthcare-dataset:https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fdataset.zip'
```
